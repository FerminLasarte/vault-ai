// user already signed up for — an instalment plan with a schedule, a loan with
// an amortisation table, a recurring movement they set up — so it is closer to

// part that would actually need estimating, is left out entirely rather than
// blended in: a number that mixes "you owe this" with "you probably will spend
// that" is untrustworthy in both halves.
//
// The primitives that produce the schedules already existed; they were only
// ever asked what was overdue. This asks them what is coming.
