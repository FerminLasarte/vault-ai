// well that is not what they can spend this week. The two currencies are two
// different pockets, so they are shown as two, with the total beside them
// rather than instead of them.
//
// A stock rather than a flow, and that distinction is why this is the one
// figure on the screen that means something with no period attached: it is the
// accumulated result of everything so far. It counts each account's opening
// balance plus every movement since — the same arithmetic the accounts screen
// does, so the two can never disagree.
