// The sequence number is why this is not a plain value: asking for the same

// carries one (see src/lib/navigation.ts). Without it the second request would
// look identical to the first and the effect below would not fire.
//
// Nothing clears the target afterwards, and that is deliberate. `printWindow`
// resolves the moment the sheet opens, not when printing ends, so clearing it
// here swapped the document out from under a preview that was still being
// drawn — the dialog showed the wrong document. Each caller names what it
// wants instead, and what stays mounted is invisible on screen anyway.
