# Vault

Local-first desktop application built with a Tauri (Rust) backend and a React/TypeScript frontend.

## Tech stack

- **Shell / runtime**: Tauri v2 (Rust backend, native webview)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript, bundled with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)
- **UI components**: shadcn/ui (components are generated into `src/components/ui` and owned by the project, not imported as a library)
- **Local data**: SQLite, embedded and accessed from the Rust side (or via a Tauri SQL plugin), for fully local-first persistence with no required backend server

## Project structure

- `src/components` — React components (`src/components/ui` holds shadcn-generated primitives)
- `src/lib` — shared utilities (e.g. `cn()` class helper)
- `src/hooks` — custom React hooks
- `src/db` — local SQLite access layer (queries, schema, migrations)
- `src-tauri` — Rust backend, Tauri commands, and native integrations

## Language policy

All source code must be written in **English**: variable names, function names, type names, comments, log messages, commit messages, and any other code-level or repository-level text. This is a strict, non-negotiable standard for this project.

The **only** exception is the end-user-facing UI copy (labels, buttons, messages shown to the user), which is written in **Spanish**, since the application's target audience is Spanish-speaking.

## UI/UX principles

The primary design directive for this project is a **minimalist, elegant, high-end** interface, in the spirit of Notion's clean, content-first UI. When building or reviewing UI:

- Prioritize clean, uncluttered layouts with generous whitespace over dense ones.
- Favor a restrained, neutral color palette and typography over decorative flourishes.
- Reuse shadcn/ui primitives and existing design tokens (see `src/index.css`) instead of inventing one-off styles.
- Motion and visual effects should be subtle and purposeful, never gratuitous.
- When in doubt, prefer removing an element over adding one.
