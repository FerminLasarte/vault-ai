# Vault

Local-first desktop app for personal finance management, built with a Tauri (Rust) backend and a React + TypeScript frontend. All data is stored locally in SQLite — no backend server required.

## Tech stack

- **Shell / runtime**: [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/) (Rust backend, native webview)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript, bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Local data**: SQLite via `tauri-plugin-sql`

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and npm
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable toolchain)
- Tauri's platform-specific system dependencies — follow the [Tauri prerequisites guide](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app in development mode (starts Vite and opens the native window with hot reload):

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## Other commands

| Command                 | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`           | Run only the Vite dev server (frontend in the browser, no native shell) |
| `npm run tauri dev`     | Run the full desktop app in development mode                            |
| `npm run tauri build`   | Build the production desktop app bundle                                 |
| `npm run build`         | Type-check and build the frontend only                                  |
| `npm run test`          | Run the test suite (Vitest)                                             |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run the suite and report coverage                                       |
| `npm run typecheck`     | Type-check without emitting output                                      |
| `npm run lint`          | Lint with ESLint (`lint:fix` applies the automatic fixes)               |
| `npm run format`        | Format with Prettier (`format:check` verifies without writing)          |

## Continuous integration

Every push and pull request runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: type check, lint,
format check and the test suite for the frontend, plus `cargo fmt` and
`cargo clippy` for the Rust side.

## Releasing

Tauri cannot cross-compile, so the Windows installer is built on a Windows
runner by `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Pushing a `v*` tag is what triggers
it; a manual run builds the same installers but attaches them to the run as
artifacts instead of publishing anything.

Write the notes for the release into `RELEASE_NOTES.md` first. The workflow
reads that file at build time and the action copies it into `latest.json`, which
is what an installed copy shows in Ajustes — notes added to the release page
after the build never reach anyone who already has the app.

Then create the draft release, from the same file, **before** pushing the tag:

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z --draft --title "Vault vX.Y.Z" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

Skipping the draft fails in a way the error does not explain. The repository
keeps Actions on read-only by default, and the workflow raises itself only as
far as `contents: write` — enough to upload assets to a release that exists, not
enough to create one, so a run with no draft waiting for it dies at the last
step with `Resource not accessible by integration`. The action never rewrites
the body of a draft, so the notes put there survive the run.

Then:

1. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
2. Wait for both jobs (~8 minutes).
3. Check the assets: both installers, `latest.json`, and a `.sig` beside every
   updater package. A missing `.sig` means the signing key never reached the
   build, and updates would be refused by every installed copy.
4. Install the build and confirm it runs.
5. Publish the draft. Until then the updater endpoint 404s and nobody, not even
   an installed copy, can see the new version.

Bumping the version means all four of `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`,
`src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`. The tag does not set it; the
one baked into the installers comes from these files.

A manual run builds the same installers and hands them back as run artifacts,
without touching any release — which makes it the way to try a change to this
workflow before a real release depends on it.

### Updater signing

`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is a repository secret and its public half lives in
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. The public half is baked into every copy that ships,
and it cannot be changed remotely afterwards — losing the private key means
losing the ability to update any copy already installed, permanently.

## Project structure

- `src/components` — React components (`src/components/ui` holds shadcn-generated primitives)
- `src/lib` — shared utilities
- `src/hooks` — custom React hooks
- `src/context` — React context providers
- `src/db` — local SQLite access layer (queries, schema, migrations)
- `src-tauri` — Rust backend, Tauri commands, and native integrations
